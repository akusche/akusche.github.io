	"The Living Hope Guest House offers a relaxing and peaceful accomodation characterized by a unique fusion of Nepali hospitality and German living standard. Sunita and Alexander do their best to create a place of rest for every guest in the otherwise quite noisy Kathmandu.
		The near Ringroad makes day trips by bus or taxi to famous sights in Kathmandu very easy. Supermarkets can be reached by walk within a few minutes. A lot of good cafés and restaurants can be found nearby in Jawalakhel and Jhamsikhel.": "Deutscher Text"
